      <h1 class="mt-4">REST API</h1>
      
      <p></p>
      
      <p>
      The Crums Timechain REST API is documented on this page.
      </p><p>
      <h2 class="mt-4">URI Endpoints</h2>
      </p><p>
      </p><p>
      The methods in this API can all be accessed via HTTP GET. Even when the HTTP call causes a change in state of the
      system or causes a new resource (eg crumtrail artifacts) to be created. This is not RESTy, as a GET
      call is supposed to be a <em>verb</em> that has no side effects (reads but doesn't touch); but it's convenient.
      Think of the choice of HTTP method in this REST API as a transport layer concern: it doesn't have verb semantics.
      </p><p>
      <h3 class="mt-4">Response</h3>
      </p><p>
      The response format is JSON. With one notable exeception, the HTTP response status is always 200 (OK); the exception is when the
      system witnesses a hash it doesn't remember seeing: in that case, the an HTTP 202 (Accepted) since a new record is in the process of
      being created. (See below).
      </p>
      <h4>Why JSON?</h4>
      <p>
      There's a good argument for a binary response format: the hash proofs are complicated, validating them requires
      deep knowledge of their structures, and tho JSON is human readable, it's still hard to interpret. So why bother?
      <ul>
      <li>JSON is easier to handle, and being text, more "transport" friendly. Importantly, it can be
      annotated with notes, and maybe even app-specific data, without breaking anything.
      </li>
      <li>With use the hash proofs seem less complicated. They share a lot of similar parts. Tho a user may never
      manually parse these parts themselves, the JSON helps build a mental picture of how the hash proofs are structured.
      (We might provide a mode that breaks block proofs into parts, so a user can more easily see how
      the hashes in a chain's block proof evolve over time, but presently, that's beyond scope.)
      </li><li>
      The aim is to port this library to other programming languages (under the same license): in that event,
      porting the existing JSON parsers from Java to another language should provide a good first step.
      </li><li>
      Finally, JSON is relatively URL-freindly. This will prove convenient for encoding hash proofs as URLs.
      This way, one can consider hosting proof validation tools at a trusted site, for example.
      </li>
      </ul>

                Accepts a new SHA-256 hash to be witnessed in the timechain and returns a <em>crum</em>
                as reciept. (A crum is a tuple consisting of a 32-byte hash, and an 8-byte UTC witness time).
                The returned crum may be later used to retrieve a <em>crumtrail</em> via the "update" method.
                The HTTP response is 202.
                </p><p>
                This method is idempotent over the duration of a [timechain] block. (The no. of blocks this
                idempotency is in effect can be configured
                in the timechain settings, but there's no reason to, since increasing it negatively impacts scalability,
                but does not offer any tangible user benefit.)
                </p>
                <p>
                In rare cases (a race between clients), this method may return a 200
                response with a fully constructed <em>crumtrail</em> (see <a href="#update">update</a>).
                To cover such corner cases, the optional query string parameters the
                <a href="#update">update</a> method takes, may also be supplied.

                Returns the chain paramaters and notary policy settings.
                These are constant, static values over a typical session. The chain
                parameters (inception UTC, time-bin resolution) are in fact immutable,
                but other policy settings may be adjusted over the life of a timechain.
                While the JSON response is meant to be parsed by software, it's somewhat
                human readable:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                <li><em>incept_utc</em> - Starting UTC of genesis block, in milliseconds.</li>
                <li><em>bin_exp</em> - Block durations (in milliseconds) and block time
                    boundaries are modeled by powers of 2. This value, called the "bin
                    exponent" defines which power of 2 is used for the time binning.
                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                    <li>10: 2<sup>10</sup> = 1024 (millis) ~ 1 second</li>
                    <li>16: 2<sup>16</sup> ~ 1 minute, 6 seconds </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <p>
                The bin exponent also delineates block time boundaries. For a given block, the minimum
                (big endian) UTC value has its rightmost <em>bin_exp</em>-bits set to 0 (zero),
                while all eligible UTC values in the block share the same remaining leftmost bits;
                and the maximum UTC value in the block has its rightmost <em>bin_exp</em>-bits
                set to 1 (one).
                </p>
                <li><em>block_commit_lag</em> - No. of (wall time) milliseconds post a
                    time block before it becomes eligible to be committed. This, in turn,
                    defines the minimum time that must elapse before a
                    <a href="#witness">witness</a>ed hash can be <a href="#update">update</a>d
                    to become a crumtrail.
                </li>
                <li><em>blocks_searched</em> - When witnessing a new hash, a service may guarantee
                    it hasn't seen that same hash within a certain window of blocks. In most cases,
                    this "feature" is unnecessary and may even be set to zero. </li>
                <li><em>blocks_retained</em> - Crumtrails are kept around for this many blocks after their
                    hashes are committed to the chain: after that they are purged.</li>

              Verifies the given URL-encoded crumtrail is committed to the timechain.
              The response (in JSON) is the same crumtrail, but with its block proof
              patched to the most recent state of the chain. A human readable summary
              precedes the crumtrail's JSON.
              </p>
              <p>
              This method primarily exists so that a crumtrail may be archived as a
              bookmark. See the <code>crum</code> CLI tool for archiving crumtrails
              from multiple timechains.

            this page is static), a ready made example cannot be provided. The

              This is slightly non-standard Base64 encoding. It uses the
              <b>URL</b> / <b>filename-friendly</b> character-set specified in
              <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-5">&sect;5 of RFC 4648</a> but
              takes liberties (discussed tho not condoned in
              <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-3.2">&sect;3.2</a>) for
              specifying boundary conditions in a way that does not require padding for our use case.
              Unlike in some other variants, padding bits must be set to '0', so as to preserve
              one-to-one-ness, and are pre-pended (two '0' bits), not post-pended.
