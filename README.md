==========

This is the source repo for the Crums time chain. A new version
of the time chain is being developed. Each lives under its own
subdirectory:

* [timechain](https://github.com/crums-io/crums-pub/tree/main/timechain) Under development
* [TC-1](https://github.com/crums-io/crums-pub/tree/main/TC-1) Legacy chain

Good things are coming.. to see what's ahead see this working
[design doc](https://github.com/crums-io/crums-pub/tree/main/tc2.md).

## Documentation
